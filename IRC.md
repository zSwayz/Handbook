IRC is a place for all of us to hang out, chat and provide support. Please follow these rules at all times. The general rule of thumb is two kicks and a ban. A ban will be at a length determined by md_5, and never be more than a week. If you have any complaints or feel you have been unfairly banned, please message md_5.


* Keep the chat at a PG-13 level.  If you think it might be inappropriate, don't say it.
* Racism, sexism, bigotry, harassment, threats, etc. are strictly prohibited. Do not use racial slurs, or bigoted remarks. Do not harass or threaten any user or use this channel as a place to coordinate attacks on others.
* No trolling, flaming, or flame-baiting. Keep discussion civil. Acting like a goof will get you removed.
* No excessive profanity. Every now and then is fine, but if every other word that comes out of your mouth is profane, that's not ok.
* Do not flood or spam the channel, abuse bots, or abuse chat color. It is impossible to hold a conversation when the channel is filled with inane chatter. Bots are here to provide information and preform other useful functions. Abusing bots by spamming commands will earn you a ban. Chat colors should be used sparingly. Do not color your chat for no good reason. If you need to paste a number of lines to the channel, use a website such as http://paste.md-5.net/. Do not run unauthorized bots that speak in the channel.
* No advertising servers, other channels, or products. Providing information in context is fine, but don't tell everyone your server IP if nobody asked for it.
* No threats directed towards other people or servers. 
* Offtopic discussion is allowed, but spigot related discussion takes priority. If somebody joins asking for support, pause your conversation and help them if you can.
* Keep the chat in English as much as possible. If you don't speak english, but another person in the channel speaks your language and wants to help, feel free to PM them.
* In dispute, of unlisted rules, moderators say is final. Any complaints about a moderators actions must be directed to md_5.
